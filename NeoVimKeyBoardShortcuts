Keyboard shortcuts and their usage:

^  if used before a character means the Ctrl key.
! if used before a character means the Shift key.



'$' or '!4'             --> Places the cursor at the last character of the line.

'^' or '!6'             --> Places the cursor at the first non-blank character in the line.

v                       --> go into VISUAL mode and then use h, j, k or l as required to select. Selection starts from the character ...
                        --> the cursor is on at the time of key press. Arrows can also be used.

^v                      --> go into VISUAL mode and then use h. j. k or l or the arrow key to select in a single line in any of the four directions
                        --> combine this with r'x' where x is a desired character and you can change all characters in the selection ...
                        --> can be used to change characters in code where they are stacked one below the other in alignment.

!v or V                 --> go into VISUAL mode and then use h, j or the up and down arrows keys to select in blocks.
                        --> the first press of !v selects the entire line the cursor is at.


'!l' or 'shift + l'     --> move the cursor to the bottom of page visible on the monitor ...
                        --> (does not move the page up only the cursor)

'zb'                    --> moves page from where the cursor is located to the bottom of the visible screen ...
                        --> in effect you have scrolled down bringing the cursor to the bottom of the screen.

'!h' or 'shift + h'     --> move the cursor to the top of the page visible on the monitor ...
                        --> (does not move the page down, only the cursor)

zt                      --> moves the page up.. it is like you hold the page at where the cursor is and drag up ...
                        --> stops when the cursor reaches the top of the monitor.
