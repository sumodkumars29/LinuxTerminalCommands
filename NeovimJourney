This is the installation process for NeoVim in Bodhi Limux on a Dell Laptop Inspiron-1545.
This terminal command adds the stable repo so that the latest version can be downloaded
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable

This terminal command installs NeoVim
    sudo apt install neovim

This terminal command checks the version of NeoVim installed    
    nvim --version

This is a Bodhi Linux OS with Boot, Boot/EFI, Root and Home partitions.
So NeoVim was installed by default in the Root partition at /usr/bin/nvim.
However NeoVim looks for its configuration files at /home/sumodk/.config

So I used the below command to confirm where NeoVim is looking at to access the config files.
    nvim --headless +"echo stdpath('config')" +q

The result I got was /home/sumodk/.config

To I navigated to that location with the below command
    cd /home/sumodk/.config/

Created a folder named "nvim"
    mkdir nvim

Navigated to the nvim folder and created the init.vim and init.lua files
    cd nvim
    touch init.vim init.lua

Added the below configuration line to the init.lua file
vim.opt.number = true   (shows the line numbers)
vim.opt.relativenumber = true   (shows relative line numbers)
vim.opt.tabstop = 4 (sets the tab distance to 4 spaces)
vim.opt.shiftwidth = 4
vim.opt.expandtab = true
vim.opt.clipboard = "unnamedplus"
vim.opt.termguicolors = true    (sets the colour theme of the editor)


ESC:    Brings to NORMAL mode.


Can use the arrow keys to navigate the document
In NORMAL mode also can use H (move left), J (move down), K (move up) and L (move right) keys also to navigate the document.

In NORMAL mode, Shift + 4 or $ takes you to the end of the line the cursor is on.

In NORMAL mode, numeric 0 takes you to the start of the line the cursor is on.

ESC (exiting to NORMAL mode) + :q  --> exits the editor

ESC (exiting to NORMAL mode) + :q! --> exits the editor without saving the changes made.

What you see on the screen is a buffer and virtual place holder for the data you enter. 

ESC + :w  --> writes the new data into the file, meaning the data is saved to the file from the buffer.

ESC + :wq --> writes the new data into the file and exits the editor

ESC + :wq </path/to/file/name>    --> writes the new data and saves a new file ... 
                                  --> this instance is only when you want to save to a file that does not yet exits ...
                                  --> meaning new file. Used to set the file to a specific path
                                  --> If a file with the name specified does not exist at the end of the given path, a new file with the specified name is created.
                                  --> If a file with the specified name exists, then the data already on the file is wiped ...
                                  --> and the new data from the buffer is inserted.

ESC + :wq <file name>             --> writes the new data and saves the file ... 
                                  --> this instance is when you want to save a new fle in the current directory. 

In NORMAL mode : 'x'              --> place the cursor over a character and press x to delete it.

In NORMAL mode : 'i'              --> places you in INSERT mode. Now NeoVim behaves like a normal text editor.
                                  --> places the cursor right before the character the cursor is on when in NORMAL mode.
                                  --> After making the required changes press ESC to return to NORMAL mode.

In NORMAL mode : 'A'              --> "Shift + a" places the cursor after the last character in the line the cursor is on.
                                  --> Does not matter where the cursor is on the line "Shift + a" will place the cursor at the end.
                                  --> It also automatically put you in INSERT mode.


In NORMAL mode : 'e'              --> Places the cursor at the last character of the word from where the cursor is currently at.
                                  --> Stops the last character after which will be a space character.
                                  --> If the cursor is presently at a space between two words the cursor will move to the ...
                                  --> last character to the right of where the cursor currently is which is followed by a space.

In NORMAL mode : 'de'             --> Deletes the characters starting from where the cursor is till the end of the word, leaving the space character after it.
                                  --> To delete a complete word place the cursor at space character before the first letter and type 'de'.
                                  --> To delete characters from a certain point in a word, place the cursor at the character ...
                                  --> from where you want to delete and press 'de'.
                                  --> To delete a certain number of contiguous words place the cursor at the space chatacter ...
                                  --> before first character of the first word, type 'd', type the number of characters you want to delete and type 'e'.


In NORMAL mode : 'w'              --> Places the cursor at the first character after the word from where the cursor is currently at.
                                  --> Stops after the last character that the cursor moved over is a space.
                                  --> Meaning if the cursor is presently at a space between two words the cursor will move to the ...
                                  --> first character to the right of where the cursor currently is.

In NORMAL mode : 'dw'             --> Deletes the characters starting from where the cursor is till the end of the word including the space character after it.
                                  --> To delete a complete word place the cursor at the first letter and type dw.
                                  --> To delete a characters from a certain point in a word, place the cursor at the character ...
                                  --> from where you want to delete and press dw.
                                  --> To delete a certain number of words place the cursor at the first character of the first word ...
                                  --> type 'd', type the number of characters you want to delete and type 'w'.

In NORMAL mode : numeric 0        --> Places the cursor at the first character at start of the line the cursor is currently at ...
                                  --> irresoective of where in the line the cursor is currently at.

In NORMAL mode : d + numeric 0    --> Deletes all character to the left of where the cursor is currently at ..
                                  --> does not delete the character the cursor is at, only those to the left till the start of the line.


In NORMAL mode : '$'              --> Places the cursor at the last character at the end of the line the cursor is currently at ...
                                  --> irrespective of where in the line the cursor is currently at.

In NORMAL mode : 'd$'             --> d + 'Shift + 4' or d$ deletes till the end of the line the cursor is currently at ...
                                  --> starting from the character the cursor is currently on ...
                                  --> and places the cursor on the character before the character the cursor was on at the time of the action.
